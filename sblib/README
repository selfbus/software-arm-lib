last review:

 com_objects.cpp:
            - added sending buffer free check before new data is loaded 
            - fixed possible loop when app was writing an object and lib was searching to update local object in same group  
  bus.cpp:
            - limit rate of sending telegram to 28 per second to avoid thermal breakdown of sending circuit

review on
   bus.cpp:
 				- added some comments
  				- fixed collision detection issue while sending ACK/NACK/BUSY
  				- introduction of collision detection window according to spec for pulse duration of 25us - 70us due to propagation delay
  				- added some states to SM for better readability of the code, Busy handling,...
  				- added error handling, convey info to upper layers
  				- added local rx buffer for parallel processing of rx telegram and bus-receiving and reply with busy to remote sender
  				- added busy acknowledgment handling
  				- added some debug macros, use of timer32_0 for debugging of state machine timing
           
 	serial I/F
  				- debugging with high speed serial terminal interface (1.5Mbaud) at PIO2_7 and PIO2_8
 

old review to fixe some issues
in bus.cpp:
- collision detection, introduction of windows to avoid detection of refelctions of low bit pulse which can extend the bit duration up to
70us
- handling of default phy addr.  (e.g. in case of uninitialized SW), set to default 15.15.255 for normal device or allow 0.0.0 for router
-compiled with ROUTER definition
- setting correct waiting time for reply and prio telegrams (according to bits in control byte of telegram)

in com_objects.cpp:
- handling of read/write of object by the APP, check for correct flag before send telegram to bus or local object (in case they share same
group addr.)
  (not completed yet)
- added default telegram rate limit in order to avoid sending stage overload




Selfbus EIB Library
===================

The library uses the following ARM components:

Bus access:

- Pin P1.8 for EIB IN
- Pin P1.9 for EIB OUT
- Pin P2.0 for programming mode led and button
- 16bit Timer #1


Test setup
----------

For the ARM you can use a LPCxpresso prototyping board. The LPC1115 is ideal,
but LPC1114 also works.

For bus access you can use a Selfbus LPC controller board. Any controller
board should be sufficient, even a module like the Gira smoke detector.

Remove the LPC922 from the controller board and make connections from the following
pins of the LPC922 socket to the ARM prototyping board:

LPC pin 2 to ARM pin P2.0
LPC pin 3 to ARM pin P1.9
LPC pin 5 to ARM pin GND
LPC pin 8 to ARM pin P1.8

Add a 100pF condensator between ARM pin 1.8 and GND


BCU type
--------

Application and library must have the same BCU type. The BCU type is set by
the compile time constant BCU_TYPE. It has to bei either 10 (for BCU 1) or 20
(for BCU 2). If in doubt, use BCU 1.

To configure it, navigate in Eclipse into the project properties,
C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings (tab) > MCU C++ Compiler > Preprocessor

In the top box "Defined symbols (-D)" there shall be a line BCU_TYPE=10  (or =20)
its there for the library and the same line shall be in the application project
