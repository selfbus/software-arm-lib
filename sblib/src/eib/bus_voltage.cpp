 *  last changes: Nov. 2024 Horst Rauch
 *                based on the BCU HW LPC1115 v1.02
 *                changes are made according to the remarks below
 *
 *
 *  **** General remarks, requirements and some generic functions for BCU startup and shutdown as well as Bus Voltage measurement ****
 *
 *  According to the KNX specification the BCU shall only draw leakage current in case Vbus is <=18v. On power up the BCU/SMPS should start
 *  operating at Vbus >18V, BCU (the LIB main function) should initialize all LIB functions and wait for Vbus >=21V before
 *  initializing the App/ trigger the UsrInitPtr and start normal operation (calling repeatedly the App/UsrPrgPtr.
 *  The BCU shall trigger the UsrSavePtr in case the Vbus is below 20V.
 *  The ADC has typically several channels and on the BCU1 and a resolution of 150mV LBS at the API/Bus interface.
 *
 *  For specific use in an App we could internally operate with different values but any Bus activity should be stopp below Vbus<=20V
 *
 *
 *  Based on the SMPS design on the BCU board the BD9G101, the accuracy of the different voltages of the BD9G101 and 1% resistors we have:
 *    - SMPS start of operation if Vbus > 23,8V/21,5V and stop operation if VBus is below 12V/9V
 *    - VDD accuracy of +-3,5%, Vddmax~3,52V, VDDmin~3,278V, Vddnom~3,397V
 *
 *  The remaining processing time for the MCU when the VBus is below the specified Vbus=20V and the stop of operation of the SMPS
 *  is about ~110ms-80ms with the C6=100uF and Iload=10mA.
 *
 *  In addition we could use the definition of the power supply slope to calculate a bus failure :
 *    A normal Bus power supply should drop the bus voltage by less than 5% during a 100ms
 *    main power outage. So we use that slope (<= 14V/s) as orientation and anything
 *    far above that is probably an fault.
 *
 *  ADC HW basics for (Bus) voltage measurement:
 *   The input pin should be defined as analog pin  (
 *   Read the BUS Voltage at the Analog PIN => VADC= (Vbus - Uf(D1)) * R12/(R9+R2+R3+R12) ~= (Vbus-05V) / 10,3
 *   The corner frequency of the RC element is ~ R12||(R9+R2+R3) * C20 = 175Hz
 *   so we do not need to sample the voltage at higher frequency. In order to avoid major leakage current trough the zener diode
 *   we could repalce that with a shottky diode to +3V3 to cut high voltage peaks at the analog input or replace R3 with 130k as the TVS
 *   is clamping voltages above ~45V. An additional diode to GND is not needed as neg. pulse should not occur. In order to give the SW a possibility
 *   to find out about the installed HW, we could use the App-Sel input (IO12-AD5 e.g. used on the relais boards)
 *   e.g. resistor to GND  -> version 1, resistor to Vdd version2 (need to find a defined value for the open situation,
 *   e.g connfigure the pin as input with pull-up/down and measure the analog voltage, Ri-up > ~40k, Ri-down > ~22k).
 *
 *   As we have an absolute error of the MCU-ADC of about +-4LSB according to spec and the +-3,5% error on the Ref voltage
 *   we have an accuracy of less than +-100mV or less than 6bit resolution. In order to increase that by 1 additional bit we do an
 *   oversampling by 4: add four consecutive measurements and divide the result by 2 with a sliding window filter.
 *   All calculations will be done with integer values (based on the ADC read out) in order to limit the use of the MCU resources.
 *   As we do not need the real voltage representation in the SW, we calculate based on the the LSB values and let the compiler calculate the
 *   number of LSB representing a dedicated Voltage level.
 *
 *   A VBus failure should be triggered (call UsrSavePtr or respective App-callback):
 *    1)slope >= 25V/s (250mV/10ms is above the error level of +-100mV) together with mean value Vbus <=20,25V(last Vbus measurement is 20V or below)
 *    2)or we have a mean value Vbus < 20V
 *
 *   For bus voltage measurements it is proposed to measure every 10ms which results with the oversampling factor of four
 *   at a max measurement bandwidth of 25Hz.
 *   The measurement could be timer triggered or based on the system timer in the main BCU loop or in the App loop.
 *   An active data transmission on the Bus will probably change measurement value by ~-1,5% of the actual VBus as
 *   we have the RC filter which has about 30dB damping for the 9,6kHz of the data signal. So we can ignore the bus state.
 *
 *
 *  To achieve start-up/shut-down as per KNX spec 3.2.1, we could change value of R18 to 330k to stop the SMPS at 18V and below or stop any MCU activity to reduce
 *  the power usage by VBus measure. In case we need longer time to save some user data and switch some relais we could reduce
 *  R18 to 270k which gives us a start of the SMPS at ~18V and a stop at ~8,6V. The BCU main function should stop any Bus activity at VBus < 20V and
 *  initialize the App at Vbus > 21V.
 *
 *
 * The function Bus voltage monitoring is moved to the sbLIB as function of the BCU in the bcu_default class
 *  used during start up procedure: after HW reset or Power-up :
 *  1. initialize basic function and features of the BCU (e.g. system tick, GPIO,  basic Bus voltage monitoring,..)
 *  2. if Bus voltage is >=18V initialize remaining BCU functions and KNX bus interface
 *  3. if Bus voltage is >21V initialize APP
 *
 *  In case of Bus failure:
 *  1. if bus voltage is < 20V send signal to App  (e.g. UsrPTRSave)in order to store volatile data
 *     and let the App switch some relays to respective state
 *  2. if Bus voltaeg is < 18V stop all BCU and App activities. If the App needs more time and power to set some
 *     functions we could  let the App active until
 *  3. the bus Voltage is below the value of correct operation for the SMPS (  xmV above the switch off level of the BD9G101)
 *     put all App activities in to reset/sleeping state
 *
 *  Proposal for some HW modifications in order to have a more precise ADC read out and Power-up/power-down phase:
 *  replace R18 with 270k and D2 with shottky diode (e.g. BAT41) towards Vdd to clamp the max analog level to Vdd
 *
 *  To let the SW find out about the HW modification, the ID2 PIO is used:
 *  - open: use normal HW version
 *  - connected to GND: use modified HW version
 *  IN bcu_default.begin the PIO is configured as input with pull up and the level is measured.
 *  If connected to a RX input device we would measure a high level (need to be confirmed by check)
 *
 *
 *
 *  To ensure reliable operation of all relais in an application it is proposed to use only relais with Un <=18V and
 *  Relais PWM supply:
 *   Omron G5Q typ 30%Un (SPST, Ri=720ohm -> Un=12V,In=16mA) and 40%Un (SPDT, Ri=360ohm, Un=12V, In=32mA)
 *   holding voltage after 100ms activation puls with Un. With min Vbus=21V Dstart= 12/21=0,57, Dhold= 12* 0,3/21=0,17
 *   respectivly Dhold+ 12* 0,4/21=0,23. Switching frequency should be 10kHz. To reduce the power we could measure the Vbus
 *   and adapt D accordingly for activation/hold.
 *
 *   Hongfa HFE20 - to be calculated based on Spec, Ri and inductance, Spec: min50ms activation at >=Un
